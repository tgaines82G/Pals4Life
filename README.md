# Pals
This website, Pals for Life, was meticulously crafted using modern web development technologies and best practices to create an engaging and user-friendly online experience. Here's a brief overview of how it was built:

HTML5 and CSS3: The site's structure and presentation were built using HTML5 for content and CSS3 for styling. This combination provides the foundation for creating structured, responsive, and visually appealing web pages.

JavaScript: JavaScript was used to enhance the website's functionality and interactivity. It's responsible for handling smooth scrolling when navigating between sections and enabling dynamic features like the "Back to Top" button.

Font Integration: Google Fonts was used to incorporate custom fonts (in this case, Lato) into the design, improving typography and overall aesthetics.

Form Handling: The donation form likely utilizes server-side scripting (e.g., PHP) to process and validate user inputs. Security measures may have been implemented to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
